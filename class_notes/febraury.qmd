ðŸ“˜ Linux Lab#SE03-2: Library/Book Sprint Zero

Before define what a Sprint Zero really is, letâ€™s see what it isnâ€™t.

- A Sprint Zero is not the phase in which the team is put together. In order to conduct a Sprint in the first place, a team must already be in place.
- A Sprint Zero is not the phase for setting up infrastructure which should already be implemented or easily implemented on demand, but not as part of a Sprint Zero.
- A Sprint Zero should not involve adding products to a backlog or Consider Planning.

The main goal of a Sprint Zero is to deliver some usable value that can be built upon by the next team. Sprint Zeros are required to:

- Create the projectâ€™s **skeleton**, including research spikes.
- **Keep design minimal**.ep design minimal
- Develop a small number of **stories** to completion.
- Be low velocity and lightweight.

More specifically, the deliverables of a Sprint Zero should be as follows:

- A **usable** piece of code, however small.
- A *+minimal** environment for writing code.
- A **prioritization** of features or a list of stories.
- A **release plan** assigning each story to a Sprint.
- A plan for the most likely implementation of **features**.

    1- Make a Borrow

    2- User Management

    3- Book Management

### **Random ID's**

Calss UUID creates id with 128 bit value

    Public static String = createID(){
        UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
        String id = uuid.toString();
        return id;
    }

::: {.callout-comment}
We need an random ID for all the objects that requires it.

## **Class 2/02/2023: Quarto: using API Rest with D3.js**

Implementar dentro de quarto el ejercicio o entrada observable (Quarto Markdown: code & data)

Rest tipo de arquitectura para hacer webs

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**

- Rest is an architectural style for building web services.

- It is based on a client-server model, where a client sends a request to a server and the server sends a response.

- RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to POST (create), PUT (update), GET (read), and DELETE (delete) data.

- A RESTful API is a simple, consistent, and easy-to-use way for applications to communicate with each other over the internet.
